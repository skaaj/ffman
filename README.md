## ffsession, _a Firefox session launcher_

Session in that context mostly refers to "collection of urls related to an activity". For example, working on some project might involve navigating to its repository, some documentations, a CI tool and so on. `ffsession` is then a tool that allows one to open all of those websites in a single command instead of having to start them one by one.

### Roadmap
The project is still in an exploration phase and for the time being, three main commands are planned. Also, it's very likely that it will be renamed later to also support Google Chrome.

âœ… `ffsession start <name>`  
Open a new window with all the tabs of session <name>

âœ… `ffsession create`  
Interactive session creation.

ðŸš§ `ffsession create --from-bookmarks <x>`  
Create a session from a bookmarks folder.

### Dependencies
Features related to fetching data from Firefox involves connecting to a SQLite database. Therefore the tool is written in Python which is the only dependency.
* Python 3.7+

### Session model
A sample session is available [there](https://github.com/skaaj/ffsession/blob/main/data/vanilla/sample.json) for reference. It is formatted in JSON. At the moment the schema is very straightforward as it is just a collection of urls. Nevertheless, the way those configurations files are organized is very important because the script depends on it.
* `/data/vanilla`: sessions created directly (yes, you can!) or from `create`.
* `/data/bookmarks`: sessions created from the last sync with Firefox bookmarks.
Last thing to note, the name of the file equals the name of the session.
